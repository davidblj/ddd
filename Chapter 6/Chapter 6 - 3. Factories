Factories

When creation of an object, or an entire AGGREGATE , becomes complicated or reveals too much of
the internal structure, FACTORIES provide encapsulation.

Much of the power of objects rests in the intricate configuration of their internals and their
associations. An object should be distilled until nothing remains that does not relate to its meaning
or support its role in interactions. This mid-life cycle responsibility is plenty. Problems arise from
overloading a complex object with responsibility for its own creation.

An association in real life to aggregates and factories

    "A car engine is an intricate piece of machinery, with dozens of parts collaborating to perform the
    engine's responsibility: to turn a shaft. One could imagine trying to design an engine block that
    could grab on to a set of pistons and insert them into its cylinders, spark plugs that would find
    their sockets and screw themselves in. But it seems unlikely that such a complicated machine
    would be as reliable or as efficient as our typical engines are. Instead, we accept that something
    else will assemble the pieces. Because cars are never assembled and driven at the same time, there is
    no value in combining both of these functions into the same mechanism."

Assembling a complex compound object is a job that is best separated from whatever job that object will have
to do when it is finished.
